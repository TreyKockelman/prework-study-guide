# Prework-Study=Guide

## Description

The purpose of the Prework Study Guide is to give students a high level overview of the main points of the prework for the full stack bootcamp and a reference document for future use. I learned a lot during this project as this was my first experience with coding in any sort and first exposure to CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. Learning the basics and processes was a great first step in my coding journey.
